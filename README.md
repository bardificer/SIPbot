# SIPbot
Hi, I'm Brad. This is one of my bots.
SIPbot is for my Senior Inquiry Project, and gathers information from different subreddits
to then later analyze. When I make the analysis code, I will add it to this repository
(and no I'm not giving you my praw.ini)

As a warning if you want to fix this, some of these have bugs and are from different stages in the process as of right now. I'll be fixing everything and adding it to this respository, and updating this readme when I update everything. Adios for now -Brad


To use properly:
  Run redditInfo.py
  Run the output through split.py
  Then analyze results through analyze.py
  
  Simple.
